 	 We bring people together to share. We give time and space for library staff to listen to and learn from peers from across the U.S. and beyond. We encourage library workers to share their know-how, problem solve together, and built a support network across the miles. WebJunction listens too, and we incorporate real solutions from libraries across the world into our training programs.
